# The-Legend-of-Zegend
A project that implements on Dijikstra's algorithm and priority queues to find the shortest path between two nodes

## Description
The Legend of Zegend is a new dungeon exploration game that reached massive success. The protagonist, Lonk, has to explore dungeons and fight bosses at the end of each dungeon. The game however, was designed for experienced players who enjoy a challenge. In the Legend of Zegend, every time Lonk moves to new room in a dungeon, they lose 1 health (measured in hearts). Therefore, the best strategy is to reach the boss room with as much health as possible.
